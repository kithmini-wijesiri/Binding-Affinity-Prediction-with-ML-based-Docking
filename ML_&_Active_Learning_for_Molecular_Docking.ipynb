However, the dynamic, adaptive nature of the protein\\-ligand binding and the contribution of the conformational entropy of the protein is insufficiently considered by protein\\-ligand docking. This can result in false positives: Even if the ligand finds a suitable pose in the binding pocket, this position is not guaranteed until the protein is allowed to explore near\\-minima conformations. Hence, short molecular dynamics \\(MD\\) simulations are recommended to evaluate the stability of the predicted binding pose.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Scoring functions used by docking programs must be cheap to compute. While the accuracy is good enough to distinguish good poses from bad poses, it can have problems sorting the best poses. For example, while most popular docking programs are able to find the experimental pose in their calculations, this pose is rarely the best one of the proposed set. Furthermore, several retrospective studies have shown that docking scores often poorly correlate with binding affinity.\n",
        "\n",
        "* While blind docking is possible, in order to reduce computational cost, docking is often only performed on a subset of the protein \\(typically around a known binding pocket\\). Choosing the correct binding site is a challenge, if the binding pocket is not known a priori.\n",
